# TODO

Open ideas and follow-ups. Current game version: **0.25.0**
(`src/data/changelog.js`). Finished work lives in the changelog, not here — this
file only tracks what is **still open**. See `AGENTS.md` for architecture,
commands and data conventions.

Section numbers are stable references (`#24`, `#36`, …) and are deliberately not
renumbered, so the gaps below are items that shipped.

## Priority order (effort vs. gain)

**Effort**: S (small) < S–M < M < M–L < L. **Gain** is the player-facing value
(★ = nice to have, ★★★★★ = core missing feature).

### Tier 1 — Worth the effort

_(empty — the last Tier 1 item, #77, shipped.)_

### Tier 2 — Big, defer

1. **#19 Online sync** — L · ★★★ — the project's first backend; needs a design
   doc and real ops for modest player value today.

### Tier 3 — Small follow-ups on shipped systems

_(empty — every shipped system's follow-ups are done.)_

## 19. Online sync (cloud saves via a database)

This would be the project's **first backend** — the app is deliberately
client-only today with `localStorage` saves. Worth a short design doc first.

- [ ] Pick a backend: a managed BaaS (Supabase / Firebase — auth + Postgres /
      Firestore) vs a small custom API.
- [ ] Auth: an anonymous device id that can later be linked to an account
      (email / OAuth) so a save can follow the player across devices.
- [ ] Sync model: a save is a single JSON blob, so at minimum keep a
      server-side revision + `savedAt` and never blindly overwrite a newer
      remote (last-write-wins is easy to lose a save with).
- [ ] Offline-first: the game must keep working with no network; sync in the
      background and reconcile on reconnect.
- [ ] Conflict handling: pick a winner / offer a choice; keep a small server
      history so a bad sync is recoverable.
- [ ] Privacy & security: ownership rules (RLS), rate limits, and what is
      stored.
- [ ] Migration: reuse `repairSave` on download and bump `SAVE_VERSION` if the
      save shape changes.

Effort: **large** (auth + conflict handling + a new server to run).

## Map cleanup reference maps
All eight non-Kanto regions have hand-measured `REGION_MAP_LAYOUTS` overrides.
`tools/map-compare/overlay-region-maps.py` draws the game's nodes on top of each
reference image (`tools/map-compare/refs/`, fetched by `fetch-refs.cjs`) to
check them. Re-run the overlay after moving or adding nodes.

Reference images kept for future checks:

- **Sinnoh** — https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/e3b63315-f949-4899-bfec-5e53edcb71bc/de3deoc-13a15e88-ca36-4f15-8824-44f4f7c83833.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiIvZi9lM2I2MzMxNS1mOTQ5LTQ4OTktYmZlYy01ZTUzZWRjYjcxYmMvZGUzZGVvYy0xM2ExNWU4OC1jYTM2LTRmMTUtODgyNC00NGY0ZjdjODM4MzMucG5nIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.2o7QyN1MjdspHH1EYhWWIpV8_2aer0TBwtswDubtGzw

## Map polish (visual)

The generated maps are readable graphs. The zone marker shows its sub-area
count, town and area/zone labels stay on screen, and a legend explains the node
types and services, so what is left here is **art**:

- [ ] Add more battle background art. There are only four base scenes
      (grassland, beach, mountain, cave) plus the biome colour grades; real
      forest/desert/swamp/volcano/tundra art would let `routeBackground` stop
      tinting a handful of images.

## Useful references when picking these up

- **Data-pipeline template:** `tools/fetch-breeding-data.cjs` — cached PokéAPI
  fetch, form ids resolved to base species, writes a `public/data/*.json`, then
  add the key to `assets/gameDataInjector.js` and re-export in
  `src/data/gameData.js`.
- **Battle hooks:** status conditions / drain live in `src/game/combat/turn.js`
  (`resolveBattleTurn`); volatile state is threaded through the game loop and
  the reducer's `UPDATE_VOLATILE`.
- **Save shape:** new state fields go in `initialGameState`, `context.js`
  (save + sanitising restore) and `src/types.d.ts`. Bump `SAVE_VERSION`
  (`src/data/config.js`) only for incompatible shape changes (add
  `LEGACY_SAVE_KEYS`).
- **Config constants** live in `src/data/config.js`.
- **Scenes / pausing phases:** the minigames (`mining`, `gameCorner`,
  `battleRoyal`, `doubles`, …), Wonder Trade, evolution, healing and the Master
  Ball throw are all phase-driven scenes rendered by
  `src/components/battle-scene.js`; the idle loop pauses for them in
  `src/game/use-game-loop.js`.
- **Verifying:** `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run validate`,
  `npm run quickplay` and `npm run build`. A headless test (mock
  `window.gameDataInjector.data` with the JSON files and `import()` the module)
  works well for reducer/combat logic.
- **Versioning:** fold a change into the top `CHANGELOG` entry; cut a new
  `GAME_VERSION` only at a milestone (secrets stay out of the changelog by
  convention).
- **Commit** each logical change; never `git push`.
